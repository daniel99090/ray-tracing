# ray-tracing

This project is a basic ray tracer implemented in Python using `tkinter` for rendering. It visualizes a 3D scene with three reflective spheres and a reflective checkerboard plane using recursive ray tracing and the Phong illumination model.

## Features

- Recursive ray tracing with reflection support
- Phong lighting model (ambient, diffuse, and specular components)
- Reflective checkerboard floor plane
- 3 Colored Shperes
- RGB color calculation and shadow detection

## Usage

 Ensure you have Python 3, then run using:
   ```bash
   python rayTracing.py
```
